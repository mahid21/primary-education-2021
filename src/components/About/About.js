                <p className="p-style">The Primary Education Journal, the only intellectual endeavor in primary
education sector, is well in the 10th year of its publication. Throughout its journey
the journal has been blessed with the contribution of the educational researchers
and practitioners in education from home and abroad. As was expected in the first
issue, the journal has by this time become a professional forum for the practitioners
in primary education. The knowledge of curriculum, methods and practices have
advanced greatly through research. National Academy for Primary Education
(NAPE) Mymensingh is also trying to disseminate those research efforts, findings
and recommendations among those who are working in the field of education and
especially in the field of primary education.
In this issue five articles appear of which one is a descriptive study that seeks to
investigate the sustainability of pre-primary education program of Plan
Bangladesh. The second article seeks to the barriers of re-enrollment of dropped
out working children to basic education. The 3rd article seeks to explore the extent
of using science process skills and the problems of practicing these skills in
promoting scientific literacy in primary science classrooms of Bangladesh. The 4th
article reveals the four-year B.Ed. (Honours) students’ attitude towards inclusive
education in Bangladesh. The 5th article attempts to find the reflection of the
components of PCK on the newly formed DPEd science curriculum.
I am indebted to the honorable members of the editorial advisory board for their
painstaking efforts in shaping the journal as an international one. I would also like
to thank the members of editorial board for the dedication they put in this
intellectual endeavor.
